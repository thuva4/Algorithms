                       otherwise.
      start_g        - The starting cost.
      cost(a, b)     - A function returning the cost for moving from one
                       position to another.
      heuristic(pos) - A function returning an estimate of the total cost
                       remaining for reaching goal from the given position.
                       Overestimates can yield suboptimal paths.
