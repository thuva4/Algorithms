/*This code will start multiplication of the numerator from the smaller end, 
and as the product of any k consecutive integers is divisible by k!, 
there will be no divisibility problem. But the possibility of overflow is still there, 
another useful trick may be dividing n - r + i and i by their GCD before doing the multiplication 
and division (and still overflow may occur).*/
